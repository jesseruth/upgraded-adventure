      "question": "Is the Grotowski Minimization Vector safe for the animals?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The Grotowski Minimization Vector is a targeted genetic therapy that affects only growth potential without altering the fundamental biology or health of the orca. All our units undergo rigorous health screenings and are certified by the Global Bio-Engineering Alliance (GBA) to be free of genetic defects. They live full, healthy lives, just in a smaller package."
