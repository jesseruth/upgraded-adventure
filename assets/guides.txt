Breeding Guide: The "Cold Water" Method
Objective: Induce mating cycle in Companion Class whales.

Temperature Drop: Using your tank's thermostat, drop water temperature from 22°C to 16°C over a 48-hour period.

Salinity Spike: Increase salinity by 15% to simulate migration waters.

Introduction: Introduce the Male and Female into the neutral breeding tank.

Java Monitoring: Run the BreedingMonitor.jar utility. It uses computer vision to track "bonding behaviors" (synchronized swimming, gentle nudging).

Success Indicator: Once the female creates a "Bubble Nest" in the corner, separation is required immediately.

The Ansible "Farm Manager" Playbook

Features:

Automated pH balancing across all IP-connected tanks.

Emergency alert system (pushes to Slack/Email if oxygen drops).

deploy_feed.yml - Synchronizes feeding times to maximize growth efficiency.

### **1. Package Contents**

Verify the following items are present immediately upon removing the outer seal:

1. **1x Bio-Stasis Bag** (Contains 1x Whale Unit suspended in *Sleep-Saline™* fluid).
2. **1x Vial of "Wake-Up" Reagent** (Red cap).
3. **1x NFC Registration Card** (Contains the unit's unique UUID).
4. **1x Acclimation Drip Hose**.

---

### **2. Inspection & Bioscan**

Before breaking the inner seal, inspect the Bio-Stasis Bag.

* **Check Clarity:** The fluid should be clear. If cloudy, the biological filter has failed. Contact Support immediately.
* **Check Vitality:** The unit will be motionless. This is normal. Look for the **gills/blowhole rhythm**. It should pulse once every 45 seconds.

---

### **3. The Acclimation Process (Drip Method)**

*Failure to acclimate may result in pH shock and void your warranty.*

1. **Float the Bag:** Place the sealed Bio-Stasis Bag gently onto the surface of your tank water. Let it float for **20 minutes** to equalize temperature.
2. **Open & Secure:** Cut the top of the bag. Secure it to the tank rim using the provided clip. **DO NOT release the whale yet.**
3. **Start the Drip:** Connect the Acclimation Drip Hose from your tank water into the bag.
* *Flow Rate:* 2 drips per second.
* *Duration:* Allow tank water to dilute the bag fluid for 30 minutes.



---

### **4. Digital Registration (Bash/CLI)**

While the unit acclimates, you must register the livestock UUID to your tank's control system to activate the feeding algorithms.

**Option A: Manual Entry (Touchscreen)**
Type the 16-digit code found on the NFC card into your tank's front panel.

**Option B: Terminal (Recommended)**
If you are running the `OrcaOS` custom firmware (Debian-based) on your tank controller, you can register the unit via SSH to update your inventory instantly.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Register the new unit
./orca-cli register --uuid="WH-2025-X99-AB" --type="companion" --name="Bubbles"

# Verify tank parameters are adjusted for new bio-load
./orca-cli status --check-oxygen

```

---

### **5. Deployment & Waking**

1. **Add Reagent:** Pour the **"Wake-Up" Reagent (Red Vial)** into the bag.
* *Reaction:* The fluid will turn slightly pink. The unit will twitch within 30 seconds.


2. **Release:** Gently tilt the bag and allow the unit to swim out into the main tank volume. **Do not pour the bag water into the tank** (it contains ammonia from transit).
3. **Observation:**
* **0-10 Minutes:** Unit will be disoriented.
* **10-30 Minutes:** Unit should surface for air (or pulse gills) and begin "mapping" the glass boundaries.

### **6. Post-Unboxing Checklist**

* [ ] **First Feed:** Do not feed for 24 hours. The digestive system needs to reboot.
* [ ] **Lighting:** Keep tank lights dimmed (or set to "Moonlight" mode) for the first 12 hours to reduce stress.
* [ ] **Ansible Inventory Update:** If managing a server farm, don't forget to update your `inventory/hosts` file with the new unit's ID so your automated health-check playbooks include it.

### **Next Step**

Here is the **Day 1 Troubleshooting Guide** found in the box.

---

# 🔧 DWARFORCA.COM | DAY 1 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Doc ID:** `DO-TRBL-DAY1-V2`
**Support Tier:** General Public & Enterprise

> **⚠️ EMERGENCY PROTOCOL:**
> If the unit stops breathing (no blowhole actitivity > 3 mins), initiate **Code Blue**. Inject the provided Epinephrine Pen (Yellow Cap) directly into the dorsal fin and call 1-800-WHALE-Help immediately.

---

### **Symptom 1: Unit is Listing / Swimming Upside Down**

**Diagnosis:** Cryo-Bladder Dysfunction.
The gas bladder often fails to re-pressurize immediately after waking from cryo-stasis, causing the whale to float belly-up. This is common and usually resolves in 2 hours.

**Corrective Actions:**

1. **Do Not Poke:** Physical correction stresses the animal.
2. **Increase Flow:** Turn your tank's wave-maker to "Storm Mode" (High Turbulence). The chaos encourages the unit to engage its core stabilizers.
3. **Salinity Adjustment:** If the issue persists > 4 hours, your water density may be too low. Increase salinity to **1.026 SG**.

---

### **Symptom 2: "Glass Surfing" (Pacing the Tank Walls)**

**Diagnosis:** Boundary Mapping Stress.
The unit is confused by the transparency of the glass and is looking for the rest of its pod.

**Corrective Actions:**

1. **Block Line of Sight:** Tape paper to the outside of the tank for 24 hours to create a visual barrier.
2. **Run Diagnostic Script:**
Check if your tank's ultrasonic barrier is active. If you have the `orca-cli` installed, run this bash command to verify the sonic containment field is on:
```bash
# Check status of the glass-repellent emitters
./orca-cli sensor --read --target="ultrasonic_emitter_01"

# Expected Output: STATUS: ACTIVE (Frequency: 45kHz)
# If INACTIVE, restart the daemon:
systemctl restart tank-security.service

```



---

### **Symptom 3: Refusal to Surface (Sitting on Bottom)**

**Diagnosis:** Post-Sedation Heavy Sleep.
The "Wake-Up" reagent hasn't fully metabolized. The unit is groggy.

**Corrective Actions:**

1. **Temperature Shock:** Lower the tank temperature by 2°C rapidly. The cold spike triggers the adrenaline response.
2. **Oxygen Injection:** Ensure your tank's air stone is directly near the unit.
3. **The "Poke" Test:** Gently nudge the tail fluke with a sanitized aquarium tong. If they do not react, administer **half-dose** of the Red Vial (Wake-Up Reagent).

---

### **Symptom 4: Aggression (Biting Glass or Other Tank Mates)**

**Diagnosis:** Dominance Assertion.
Even "Teacup" breeds are apex predators. They are establishing territory.

**Corrective Actions:**

1. **Isolation:** If you have other livestock, install the acrylic divider immediately.
2. **Feed Distraction:** Drop a single "Ice-Cube Treat" (frozen krill block). It forces them to focus on melting the ice rather than attacking reflections.
3. **Firmware Patch:** Older tank controllers may emit a hum that irritates the whale's sonar. Ensure your Java controller is updated:
```java
// Check your TankController.java config
if (sonarFrequency < 20000) {
    System.out.println("Warning: Low frequency hum detected. Aggression risk high.");
    SonarSystem.setFrequency(50000); // Set to silent range
}

```


---

### **Symptom 5: Unit "Clicks" Constantly at the User**

**Diagnosis:** Imprinting Attempt.
The whale is using echolocation to "scan" your internal organs and recognize you as the Alpha/Provider.

**Corrective Actions:**

1. **Do Nothing:** This is a good sign.
2. **Stand Still:** Allow the unit to hover and click at your chest level for 5 minutes.
3. **Voice Interaction:** Speak softly. The unit is building a voice-print database.
