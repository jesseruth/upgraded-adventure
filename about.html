        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Dwarf Orca was founded with a simple mission: to create adorable, high-quality killer whale merchandise that brings joy to orca enthusiasts everywhere. We believe that killer whales are magnificent creatures that deserve to be celebrated and appreciated through fun, collectible products.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>We're dedicated to creating the most delightful killer whale collectibles on the market. From plushies that are perfect for cuddles to figurines that deserve a place on your shelf, every product is designed with care and passion for these incredible marine mammals.</p>

        <h3>Why Orcas?</h3>
        <p>Killer whales are intelligent, social, and fascinating creatures. Despite their name, they're actually the largest members of the dolphin family. Their beauty, playfulness, and complex social structures make them endlessly inspiring. We wanted to share that passion with our community.</p>

        <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> We only sell premium merchandise that's built to last</li>
          <li><strong>Passion:</strong> Every product reflects our genuine love for orcas</li>
          <li><strong>Community:</strong> We're building a community of orca enthusiasts</li>
          <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> A portion of proceeds go to orca conservation efforts</li>
          <li><strong>Fun:</strong> Life's too short not to love killer whales</li>
        </ul>
